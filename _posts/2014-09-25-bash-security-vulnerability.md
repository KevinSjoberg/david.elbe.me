title:  Bash vulnerability - what it means and how to fix it

The RedHat team unconvered a little but nasty bug in bash today. It allows
people to execute code on your machine without permission. I have seen two names
being used: _Shellshock_ and _The Bash Bug_.

Bash incorrectly parses functions in environment variables. Environment variables
is usually ment for configuration settings. For example, Ruby on Rails has the
RAILS_ENV-variable that usually is set to 'development' or 'production' so the
application knows in which setting it should run.

## How can it be used?

An example where this can be used is when you have access to a system via ssh,
but with limited access (for example via git-shell or as a webhosting user).
Most of the time you have the right to set environment variables to the system,
and this can now be used to run any code.

If you allow your users to run cron scripts on the server, this can also be a
way to run code via bash.

System calls from PHP scripts in CGI-mode can be vulnerable (but not if they are run with
  mod_php).


## Check if your system is vulnerable

Most systems running bash are vulnerable, and Mac OS X in particular since
they are using an old version of bash. You can input the following code in
your terminal (don't worry, all it does is print some text). I checked on a
recently installed Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS and it was also vulnerable.

{% highlight ruby %}
env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c 'echo test'
{% endhighlight %}

If it outputs 'vulnerable' then your system is not secure agains this attack
and needs to be updated. If your system outputs 'warning' and a message that
bash is ignoring the function definition attempt your system is okay.

## How to update bash on Ubuntu

``apt-get update && apt-get upgrade bash``

Or just run `apt-get upgrade` - it needs to be done sooner or later anyway.

## How to update bash on Mac OS X

[This thread on Stack Exchange](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/146849/how-do-i-recompile-bash-to-avoid-the-remote-exploit-cve-2014-6271)
has instructions on how to manually update. Given the severity of this bug I
expect Apple to release a fix shortly.
