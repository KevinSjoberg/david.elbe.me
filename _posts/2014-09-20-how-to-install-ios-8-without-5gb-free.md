title:  How to install iOS 8 without having 5GB free

Since a few of my friends complained that they could not update their iphones
to iOS 8 without deleting almost everything I decided to write this quick blog
post on how you can do it without having 5GB free on your device.

The trick is to connect your iphone to a computer with iTunes installed. Then
you can download the iOS 8 installer and do the update from there. You see,
it is only the _installer_ that requires 5GB of space. The system itself when
installed takes about 1 GB, about the same as iOS 7.

I guess the installer gets more and more complex for every release, since it has
to care for more settings and more devices every time to be backwards compatible.

Just connect the iPhone to your computer via an USB cable, start iTunes and
press the _"Check for update"_ button.

I still haven't updated my iPhone. I usually wait a couple of weeks until the
first bug fix-release is out. This saves me a lot of headache every time. I do
the same with most operating systems and new phone models. Being an early adopter
is fun, but I don't understand people who do it with work equipment.

Anyway, good luck with your iOS 8 update. Let me know how it worked for you in
the comments below.
