title:  Side projects - why it is important for every developer

I have met hundreds of developers. The best ones always have a side project
or two that they hack away on at night. As an employer I encourage that, but
I have heard that a lot of workplaces ban personal projects.

So let's talk about why I think that side projects is a good thing, how I use
them to get better and what you have to look out for.

## Personal development

Development, programming (and web development in particular) is a fast-changing
field where you have to learn new things once in a while. Don't get me wrong –
you certainly don't have to try every new javascript framework or new in-the-cloud
database to be a good developer. I am all for being an expert on a few things
and have a basic understanding of the rest, so if you chose to focus on Django
and jQuery and want to be the best on that combo - good for your. But make sure
you evaluate things like Go, Dart, Less, Slim and Gulp when they pop up on your
radar.

Evaluation can be very shallow, just by looking at the code examples and get
an understanding of what the new tech can do. Or - if you find it interesting -
make a side project of it. Rebuild one of your simpler apps in the new language/framework
if you like their approach in theory.

## Lab testing before human trials

There is a reason why scientist try out new medicine in a lab before they go on
to human trials. Things can go wrong even if they seem good in theory.

Your employer should thank you for trying out new stuff in your personal projects.
I have seen far too many live customer projects go wrong because a developer just
liked the idea of testing something completely new. Sometimes everything works
out with that new MongDB-adapter, and sometimes it breaks badly – and you have
no experience building real stuff with it. So try it out in a personal project
before you even think about using it at work.

## What is a good side project?

I like my side projects to solve real problems for me or for someone else.
It can be a small ruby gem, a web app, an Android app or a widget for the latest
apple watch.

## Timeframe

Another thing that I like to do is give myself a timeframe. This does not work
 for everyone, but I need some time pressure to finish the project and make
 sure it does not get too big. So the first day of any given month I wrap up
 the old project and start a new one. That does not mean I never work on it again,
 but it

## Side projects should be fun
Note that your side project **should be fun**, and this is important. Fun can be
the problem itself or the new technology, but don't start at side project that
solves someone elses problem with a technology you are not really interested in.

It will feel like work, and make little to no contribution to your own
development. If you need the extra cash, check with your employer if it is okay
to run this project as a paid freelancing gig - or maybe sell it as work and
get even more recognition from your employer as the employee who can contribute
with new clients/jobs as well.

## Open source it

Consider open sourcing your side project. You will learn more when your code
is open for everyone to see. And no, it won't you from making money.

## What? Making money? You have my attention.

First: Side project should not be about making money. Developers generally earn enough
money so they should not have to have extra work on the side. Focus on solving
the problem and learn new things instead.

That said, it is cool when you get your first payment for a product you created
on your own. I remember my first sale in App Store for a simple live scoring app
for a local hockey team. It felt crazy that someone wanted to pay me real money
for an app I made for fun.

I may write blog posts about how you can make some extra cash on your side projects
in the future, but start by solving a problem that you have and it will be
a lot easier to sell later.

## Sometimes it does not work

See, I told you that shiny new framework maybe is not such a good idea after all.
Once in a while your side project will take a lot more time than expected, or
you will find it boring after a couple of weeks. That is okay. That is why it is
a side project and not your day job. Throw it away and start on something else.
You will have a story to tell at work on why we should not pick this option or
why that library is a bad choice. Everyone will be thankful that you took the
time to make a crash landing outside a project that they are involved in.

## Contribute to someone else's project

Reading code that someone else and fix bugs in it will make you learn a lot.
