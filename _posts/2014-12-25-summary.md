The last two months of the year I have focused on finishing the upper floor of our house,
so we don't have to sleep in the living room as we currently do. I goes really well,
and a few days ago we finished the floors and painted the walls. With the exception of a few finishing touches
and lots of furniture that needs to be moved it is almost ready. I have not really
had the time to work on any personal development projects lately.

2014 is coming to an end, and I have had a crazy year consisting of both good and bad things.

 * I (With lots of help) have built/renovated a house
 * I became the father of an amazing little girl ([Noelle](http://noelle.elbe.me/)) and watched her through
the first 10 months of her life.
 * I fired an old friend from my company.
 * I got a new stakeholder in my company.
 * I created [Gramfilter.com](https://gramfilter.com/)
 * I created [Devb.io](http://devb.io)

## Becoming a father

She came out almost a month early, but everything went well and little Noelle is really an amazing girl.
I am finding joy in teaching her new things about the world, and she is amazed by every little detail and
it makes me appreciate life a little bit more.

I am taking more photos than ever. All of them are of my daughter. I guess everyone on my Instagram feed
is tired of seeing them.

## Time

I don't have as much time as I used to have. Just being a father takes up most of my time, both during days
and nights. She does not sleep very well, but it could have been worse. :)

I spend every monday home with my daughter, and I usually work until 5pm every day, and then promptly head
back to home. Family life feels more important than work.

## Focus

The lack of time gives me a lot more focus than I used to have. That is a good thing. Just 'surfing the web'
is not happening often anymore. I am getting a lot more done in less time.

## Looking forward

I am currently compiling a list of goals for 2015. I'll try to get it posted before new year's eve.
