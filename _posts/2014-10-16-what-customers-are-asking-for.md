I met with a customer today and told him about my side project. Or, not really,
I told him about Instagram and embedding photos on his website. His first question
was: 'How can we be sure that nobody puts up bad stuff there?'

Bingo. My october side project was validated. A moment later one
of our other customers called. Their Instagram feed on their website had broken
down. I guess I have to finish my Instagram moderation tool soon.

## Customers asking for a solution is gold

I think the right way to create a side project is to find people that you can
understand with a problem you can fix within a reasonable time frame. For me,
this is a perfect example. We create websites over at [Standout](http://standout.se/)
all the time, and embedding photos from a specific hashtag on Instagram is a
really god use case on how to spice up a website and engage the visitors.

You have to be the filter. Not every idea is a good one, and the execution of
the idea is far more important thand the idea itself. But if you want it to
sell from the beginning – find a real problem that real people express.

## Status update

So, I have spent some time on the side project. Here is what I have done so far:

 * Create a new account
 * Log in/log out
 * Add new feeds
 * Change feed settings
 * Add whitelisted Instagram account names
 * Moderate images for all your feeds
 * Manually refresh feeds
 * Embed feeds on your homepage

Pretty good for the limited time I have spent on it.

So, tomorrow I am putting the web app online for a few selected clients to use.
I expect them to be paying customers once it is stable.

The site is ugly, navigation confusing, things are buggy – but it is starting
to come together. Given another week it will look much better.

Time spent so far: 20 hours. It is really tough to find the time when you have
kids. Good thing a customer asked for it so I could spend a little more time
at work on this.
