When you're building a web app or other type of online business you
probably have a lot of questions. I think learning from others is 
a great way to become a better entrepreneur, no matter if you're
bootstrapping your way with your first SaaS product, or trying
to build a great freelancing business selling yourself as a consultant.

Here I will be adding good online discussion forums that
will help you build your online business. Please add your favorites in the comments.

## Discussion forums

 * [Discuss.bootstrapped.fm](http://discuss.bootstrapped.fm) - Discussion board for the Bootstrapped Podcast, with new posts every day.

 * [Bootstrappers.io](http://www.bootstrappers.io) - a community of business bootstrappers, freelancers and lifestyle designers.


 * [Multi-Reddit for Web Entreprenurs](http://www.reddit.com/r/entrepreneur+business+marketing+motivation+smallbusiness+startups) - a collection of subreddits for the startup/business owner.

 * [Sitepoint Business Forum](http://community.sitepoint.com/c/business) - SitePoint has a forum, but recently it is mostly posts linking to Sitepoint articles. Has potential though, with Sitepoint's large audience.

 * [Quora - entrepreneurship](http://www.quora.com/Entrepreneurship) - Q&A style discussion forum with entrepreneurship topics.

 * [Growth Talk](http://www.growthtalk.co) - Focusing on growth hacking. Not as active as the Bootstrapped discussion board, but occasionally a good topic or two shows up here.

 * [Founder News](foundernews.io) - Just found this today and added it to the list. They're mostly linking to news stories for founders.
