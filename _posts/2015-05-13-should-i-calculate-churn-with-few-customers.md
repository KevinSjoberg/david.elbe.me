Sometimes calculating churn just does not make sense. 

Let's say you have a SaaS app that you're just starting out, or naturally
have a small audience. 

Does it make sense to calculate the churn with such a small user base?

Probably not. But I usually recommend my clients to do it anyway. Why? It makes
sense to establish good habits early, and churn is one of the [Key Performance Indicators](/saas/2015/05/07/what-is-a-kpi-and-what-do-i-track.html) that you really should track from the start.

The calculation formula is exactly the same as for big
apps, but with low customer numbers your churn will fluctuate a lot. Some months will be zero churn, some will be really high. 
So, don't care a lot about the numbers. Care about the habit of tracking your web app's growth.

Your focus with such low numbers will be:

  * How do I get more customers?
  * If someone cancelled their plan - why did they do it?

So, get in the habit of *tracking* and you will have a good platform for when your app grows bigger.
