Installing [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org) on your Mac is easy, but I've seen people struggle with trying to compile it from source. That is definitely not necessary on a Mac OS X install. For other platforms, see the [official install guide](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html).

* Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) (Mac OS X package manager) if you haven't already
* Open a Terminal. I like iTerm 2, but the built in Terminal.app works fine.
* Type `brew update` to make sure your Homebrew installation is up to date.
* Type `brew install elixir` to download and install the Elixir package
* Now you should have a working Elixir installation. You can type `iex` in your terminal to confirm that the Elixir promt is starting.

That is it! Installing Elixir is easy. You probably didn't even have time to grab a cup of coffee.
