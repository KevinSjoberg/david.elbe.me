Pricing is hard. If you're a developer like me you probably think
writing 10 000 lines of code is much easier than determining
how you should price your product.

Today I'm going to talk about two different pricing strategies
and why you probably should pick *fixed price* instead of charging *per use* 
(also called metered pricing).

## Reason 1: It makes it easier for the customer

If pricing is hard for you it is equally hard for the customer. 
Deciding what plan to pick should be as easy as possible. If you 
can you should limit your plans to 3. One is even better.

By having metered pricing, i.e. when the customer is paying per
use they have to do the math themselves. Most people don't like
to do maths, especially not when they're trying to sign up
for a service.

## Reason 2: Budgeting and predictability

A customer wants to know how much a service costs. They often
have a budget to stick to, and most people with a budget prefer
to pay a slightly higher price to know exactly how much
things are going to cost.

Take your phone bill for example. More and more people that
use their phone a lot prefer to pay a fixed monthly price
with all-you-can-eat text messaging and calls included.

 > "Okay, my phone bill will be $49 each month. I can afford that."

Make it easy for your customer to plan their expenses. 

## Reason 3: Avoid hit-and-run customers

Having one-off customers that sign up for your app, uses
it for a couple of days and then leaves never to return again
makes it hard to run a business. Since they're only paying
for usage they are not bound to your service in any way.

Hit-and-run customers are not loyal per definition. You want
to have loyal customers. Is that a good enough reason?


## So what should I do?

Without knowing anything about your app I suggest you stick with
1-3 fixed price plans. You'll have to make sure you have a margin on each of
these plans, and you can limit usage in each plan.

In each plan you can limit things like 'storage space' or 'number of users', but
paying for *Number of logins in a month*, or having *$0.02 per megabyte* is
not a good idea. People will get nervous when they can not control the costs.
