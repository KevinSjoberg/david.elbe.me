Do you know how to tell a web developer that comes straight
from university from someone who has years of experience
in the business? The new ones can not estimate time on tasks at all.
The experienced ones sucks a little bit less, and gives you an
estimate that can be multiplied by 2 or π to get a somewhat correct
guesstimate of what the real effort might be.

I checked my estimates for the last three years, and they are pretty
much spot on. How come I and other seasoned developers can correctly
estimate the time required to build a web app when most new developers can not?

Here are my short rules that I use to estimate most software projects.
Note that most of our projects are between 25 and 500 hours, so nothing
really huge - it is small to medium size projects in our market.

### Don't experiment on client projects

This is a big mistake that most new developers do. When you hire a
carpenter or a car repair guy, do you want them to try out their
newest experimental tools that they have never used before? If things
take twice the time just because they are experimenting, do you as
a customer want to pay double the price of a regular exam?

Side projects are for trying stuff out. Not client work when someone
(client or employer) pays you by the hour.

There are of course some exceptions to this. Some clients are willing
to pay you to experiment, but that is a whole different thing.

### Start by estimating what you have already done

The longer you have worked in the business the more things you have done
in the past. Take advantage of that knowledge, and start your estimates
by writing down your estimated times for the tasks that you already
have done before.

### Estimate what YOU will do, not what others will do

Estimating for other people without their written consent is generally a
bad idea. Will you do all the coding yourself? If not, get an estimate
from the other people involved.

If someone struggles late in the project, they always blame the estimator
first, then the client. Make sure everyone estimates their own part.

### Look at the history

Your first estimate will probably not be perfect, but every failed
estimation should be an opportunity to learn. Compare with your past
estimates, or ask your colleagues if they have done it before.

Was it successful? Did it feel rushed? Did we learn something that
we could re-use in this project?

### Estimate in hours, days and week

My estimations normally are grouped in to the following time groups:

 * 1 hour
 * 2 hours
 * 4 hours
 * 8 hours (one day)
 * 2 days
 * 3 days
 * 1 week (40 hours)

For tasks that take less than one hour I group several small tasks
together. I never estimate tasks longer than 1 week, because it adds
too much uncertainty, just divide it into several smaller tasks.

### Don't forget communication and meetings

Generally about 10-15% of your time will be spent communicating with
the client. Sometimes I have a specific bullet point on my estimates
for this, sometimes I just round up all estimations a little bit to
make room for communication time.

### Plan for bugs

Customers don't like to pay for bug fixes. You can make your customers
feel much more content with your time spent on bug fixes by planning
ahead and make room for them in your estimate. I never write out 'Bug fixes'
in my estimates, but instead make a little room for this in each task, just
like I do with communication.

### Plan for deployment

Coding your web app and putting into production are two completely
different things. Make sure you allow time for setting up the
server, backup and other deployment related tasks.

### Sketch it out

Describe the user interface with pictures and words so that both you
and your client are happy with the result on paper before you begin
coding. Most of the time I do this before even estimating. For larger
apps I charge for this as 'software architecture' but for simpler
projects like websites I normally see it as a part of the sales process
and do it for free.

Sometimes I ask the customer to do this for me, and make revisions
to their work instead.

Describing the end result in this way with pictures and words both
make the estimation part easier and also eliminates lots of the
'This is a Bug!'-discussions that can arise if you don't share a
common view of the end result.

I've had some projects that ended directly after the sketch phase
because the client realized that they had not thought the whole
app through. Good for both of us. I always want to exceed people's
expectations, and I can not do that if I don't know what their
expectations are.

### Keep the estimates close when you are working

Print out a copy of the estimated times and keep it on your desk,
or write them on Post It-notes à la Kanban/Scrum if that is your
thing. I always try to be conscious about the estimated times
on my projects, and aim to do it in about 75% of the alotted time.

I've seen colleagues just work through the whole project and then
compare their estimate with the final result and go 'Oh, shit - this
took a lot longer than I expected'. Of course it did. You did not
work through your promises, you only tried to solve the problem.

The proposal is your promise to the customer. I know it is only
'an estimate', but if you keep estimating wrong all the time
your clients will be angry with you.

### Follow up

After the project, always write down how your estimate compares
with the real time spent. If you don't do this you will never learn
to become better at estimating software projects.
