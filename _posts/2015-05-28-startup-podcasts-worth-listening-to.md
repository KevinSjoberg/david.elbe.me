I truly enjoy a good podcast when walking to my office, or doing household chores, or driving my car. I tend to listen a lot to business podcasts, and especially startup-related podcasts talking to the bootstrapping part of the startup world.

Here are my list of podcasts – aimed at startup owners, web entrepreneurs and bootstrappers – that I find worth listening to on a regular basis. 

## Startups for the rest of us

Rob and Mike are genuinely good guys, trying to make the lives of fellow startup founders a little bit easier. Last episode was about e-mail list building, and with well over 200 episodes in the archive I'm sure you will find something that helps your business.

They are shipping good and short episode every week. I like their no-nonsens friendly style.

## Chasing Product

Christopher Hawkins is trying to transition from consulting work to building product, much like myself. He struggles a lot and talks about his failures and struggles, which I find refreshing - even if he sometimes sounds a bit depressed when his product idea is not coming together in the pace he wants it to.

Most of the show is a long interview with the guest of the episode, and since Christopher picks his guests with care he is always up for interesting talks with really inspiring people. The one thing I don't like is his inconsistant schedule, but I'm always happy when a new episode shows up in my podcast player.

## Mixergy

I've never met with Andrew Warner – the host of Mixergy – but it feels like he is my friend. I've heard his voice so many times, and
he talks open-heartedly about the successes of failures of both his own and his guests ventures on his podcast. Mixergy is an interview-style podcast, which works well for Andrew since he has a thing for getting people to answer almost any question to both his and his guest's surprise. 

This is a mix of really big companies and smaller startups. I use it mainly as a source of inspiration, to see what others have achieved and learn from some of the mistakes they have made. High quality almost every episode. 

He is producing several episodes per week, and I think it can be a bit much. I have unsubscribed from the show in iTunes a couple of times because I felt there was too much content, but I keep adding it back because the interviews are so valuable and inspiring. A weekly schedule would work better for me, but I guess I should not complain about getting too much of the good stuff.

## Product People

Interesting show with irregular schedule. I like the interview style of the podcast episodes, and the strong focus on people building web based products. This is an area that I know well and I always want to listen to the next episode when the current one has finished.

## Smart Passive Income Podcast

I don't like the somewhat cheesy name, but I like everything else about Pat Flynn's great podcast. He talks a lot about building money-making machines and has a strong focus on serving a particular niche. This is filled with great advice, especially for the beginner in online money making. I enjoy listening to the interviews and hear more about how Pat is building his business and living the life of an entrepreneur who has made it.
